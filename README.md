- 👋 Hi, I’m @taylor-carbin
- 👀 I’m interested in travel, reading, upping my cooking skills, Gilmore Girls, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and working out.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything I possibly can. It's kind of a problem. But the focus for now is JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I'm honestly not sure yet. Still new here.
